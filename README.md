## What is Powerrent?
Quite simple, bringing piracy ever so closer to discord.

### Adding the plugin
Copy and paste the code below into the terminal for powercord's plugins folder
```
cd powercord/src/powercord/plugins
git clone https://github.com/Crenshaw1312/Powerrent
cd Powerrent
npm i
```

## Current Issues
Private Trackers don't work
> This will be done soon, a username and password field will be required. There will also be more private trackers added like RED and OPS.

## Coming Soon
- Find Repacks command  
    Search allover (reddit, forums, discord etc) for repacks
- Repacks Release Notifs  
    Will notify you of new repack releases

## Will it be for BetterDisccord one day?
For now, no. I use powercord since it is much friendlier to use on the developer side, and making it compatiblie with BetterDiscord would require an entire rewrite, and may not work the same, or at all.

If I get enough people asking for it, then maybe, otherwise it's a no.
